#Classification with nearest neighbors
  #Machine learning: utilizes computers to turn data into insight and action
    #subset of machine learning = supervised learning: training a machine to learn from prior examples
    #classification: concept to be learned is a set of categories
      #e.g. identifying diseases, is image a cat, etc.
  #Classification tasks for driverless cars
    #e.g. classifying signs, objects in distance
  #Understanding neartest neighbors
    #to start training driverless car, would supervise by demonstrating desired behavior
    #as it observes each sign
    #after some time under instruction, vehicles builds database recording sign & target behavior
    #imagine a set of similar images:
      #a nearest neighbor classifier takes advantage of fact that
      #signs that look alike should be similar to/nearby other signs of same type
    #measuring similarity with distance
      #how nearest neighbor learner decide whether two signs are similar
      #it doesn't measure distance between signs in physical space - but instead it 
      #imagines the properties of signs as coordinates in feature space
      #E.g. consider color - is imagined as 3D feature space, signs of similar color are
      #located naturally close to one another
      #then measure distance through geometric formula (e.g. eucledian geometry)
    #Applying nearest neighbors in R
      #An algorithm called k nearest neighbors (knn) uses the principal of nearest neighbors
      #to classify unlabeled examples
      #R's KNN function searches the dataset for observation most similar to newly observed observation
    #knn function: in "class" library
      library(class)
      pred <- knn(training_data, testing_data, training_labels)
      #requires 3 parameters: 1) set of training data, 2) test data to be classified, 3) labels for training data
