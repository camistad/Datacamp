#String Manipulation with stringr
#Strings: Elements of character vectors
#stringr is a package for manipulation strings
  #better than base because consistent syntax, simplified options, sensible defaults
#requires use of regular expressions: a language for describing patterns in text
  #e.g. Starts with C or a dollar sign followed by 2 or more digits
#rebus package
  #Find and replace parts of strings
  #Read in text 
#Entering strings
  #\ is used as an escape clause, tells R to treat certain keyboard entries as their
  #actual text, rather than a special character
  #e.g. can use backslash to escape a double quote in character elements
#When to use " vs. ' for wrapping text
  #No quotes in the string, use double quotes
    #e.g. "hi!"
  #Double quotes in the string, use single quotes
    #e.g. 'I said "hi!"'
  #Double and single quotes in the string, use double quotes + \ escape clause
    #e.g. "I'd say \"hi!\""
#Turning numbers into strings
    #Common use of strings is reporting numerical results
    #Allows ability to automate, update, and use in future
    #Recommends format or formatC
      #Give you control of how a number is represented as a string
  #Fixed and scientific formats
    #Fixed: decimal point between ones and tenths
    #Scientific: decimal point after first digit
      #6371 = 6.371 x 10^3
      #6.371 = 6.371e+3
    #Helps read order of magnitude    
#format and format c
  #Take a vector of numbers as input
  #format: scientific = whether to use fixed (false) or scientific (true) format
  #formatc: format = whether to use fixed("f") or scientific("t")
#Putting strings together
  #paste() - takes strings as input and puts it together
    #sep argument, controls character used to separate arguments
    #paste() gets useful to pass in vectors of strings
      #Every vector passed in gets recycled to length of longest vector
        #once all vectors recycled to same length, strings combined element by element
        #recycling behavior means vector passed in can all be different lengths
  #usually, you use paste with a mix of fixed strings and variables
    #collapse argument further collapses all resulting strings into 1, 
      #with specified character between them
    #Can use paste to annotate numbers, etc.
